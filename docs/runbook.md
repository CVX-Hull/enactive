# Operate, recover and retain evidence

Supported scope: one prepared local macOS game.
For fresh installation use [setup](setup.md); use [overview](overview.md) for limits.

## Start and observe

First inspect existing terminals/processes to avoid starting a second game or
controller. A native app lookup by name may launch a second copy when the game
was started directly by its wrapper; do not use lookup as a process-existence check.
Use the existing spectator to inspect native frames when a tool cannot bind the
already-running native window.
Do not kill an unrelated service to free a port. From this checkout,
use separate terminals, an available loopback port, and only the prepared wrapper:

```sh
.venv/bin/python -m harness serve --port 8766
.runtime/Cataclysm.app/Contents/MacOS/Cataclysm.sh
```

Open http://127.0.0.1:8766/ to watch. Port 8766 was used for the MVP because 8765
was occupied; current availability must be checked. Observe, interpret the frame,
then explicitly resume. Read returned session/revision after every command:

```sh
.venv/bin/python -m harness observe
.venv/bin/python -m harness resume
.venv/bin/python -m harness action inventory --expect SESSION:REVISION
.venv/bin/python -m harness walk north --steps 3 --expect SESSION:REVISION
.venv/bin/python -m harness pause
```

SESSION:REVISION is a placeholder for values from the observation used to decide
the action. Resume changes revision. `ready` is an input-boundary acknowledgment,
not proof that an objective succeeded. Reinterpret prompts and new frames. The
viewer goal field records an objective; it does not start another agent.
A registered action can be rejected if it has no usable single-key binding. A
walk may report `stopped` after all requested steps completed; inspect `steps`
and the frame before deciding again. See the [protocol](protocol.md).

## Pause, timeout and recovery

Pause prevents subsequent remote dispatch. Native keyboard/button input also
latches takeover. Neither guarantee cancels an already-running native activity;
use the native window to interrupt it. Do not spam remote keys to escape a stall.

For a timeout or frozen viewer: preserve the error/journal and last frame; inspect
the native window. Unsupported upstream error screens may need native dismissal.
Observe to reconcile current state, then explicitly resume only when interpretable.
Do not resend an uncertain action. New observations do not prove its old objective.

For service restart: stop that service normally, start one controller, observe
and reconcile, then resume. For a game crash/restart: preserve diagnostics, launch
the prepared wrapper, use normal CDDA load UI, and acquire new session authority.
Old-session commands must not be reused. No save-file repair/editing is prescribed.

Use CDDA's normal Save menu before quitting. Stop the controller with Ctrl-C; it
leaves remote control paused. Saves are in `.runtime/user/`. Never treat a stale
frame or old acceptance record as proof a current process is healthy.

## Native acceptance lane

Required after relevant native/input/renderer/protocol/source-pin/compiler changes,
and before new native support claims. Complete relevant probes on an isolated
project profile, windowed, without hidden information or edited saves:

1. Build the pinned source using setup; record compiler, inputs and binary hash.
2. Inspect actual native and spectator frames, including menus and popup text.
3. Exercise observation, bounded input, stale authority, pause and native takeover.
4. Exercise the changed behavior plus timeout/reconciliation and restart as relevant.
5. Use normal save/load if persistence or session identity is affected.
6. Record each outcome, unknown/failure and scope in a dated report and small manifest.

The [MVP report](acceptance/2026-10-17-mvp.md) is an example and historical evidence,
not an executable current pass. Portable tests never substitute for this lane.
A new automated native replay/probe runner remains a documented coverage gap.

## Evidence retention and cleanup

Track small reports/manifests, source pins and checks in Git. Keep user saves,
large media, journals, credentials and downloads out of Git. A manifest records
artifact relative path, byte count, hash, source/candidate and limitations. Snapshot
journals before indexing them: a live journal can append even during normal shutdown.
Keep the full live journal, label the snapshot/cutoff, and verify its bytes/hash; do
not truncate a journal or overwrite a historical hash to hide later events. A hash
identifies bytes; it does not prove the depicted behavior without inspection.

Retain curated acceptance artifacts and failure evidence until superseded by
reviewed equivalent evidence or explicitly selected for removal; if removed,
record availability as removed in the evidence index. Keep unresolved-incident
journals until resolved. Routine unreferenced journals/frames can be pruned after
30 days, only with sessions stopped and after checking references/ownership.
This initial policy is manual; no scheduled deletion is installed. Native frame
rotation within a live process remains the game's existing bounded behavior.

Never delete saves as routine cleanup. Preserve manifests before removing owned
build directories/downloads. Identify the exact path from the build manifest and
verify its checkout ownership marker; never use broad /tmp or global-cache cleanup.
For a lost temporary build, re-extract using setup. For an unreadable archive,
remove only the named corrupt cache entry after preserving diagnostics.

Fresh source checkouts contain acceptance metadata but not local demo media.
Maintainers must distinguish unavailable evidence from a newly failed probe.
